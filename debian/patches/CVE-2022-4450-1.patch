Subject: [PATCH] Avoid dangling ptrs in header and data params for
 PEM_read_bio_ex

In the event of a failure in PEM_read_bio_ex() we free the buffers we
allocated for the header and data buffers. However we were not clearing
the ptrs stored in *header and *data. Since, on success, the caller is
responsible for freeing these ptrs this can potentially lead to a double
free if the caller frees them even on failure.

Thanks to Dawei Wang for reporting this issue.

Based on a proposed patch by Kurt Roeckx.
